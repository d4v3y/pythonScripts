There was once a man. The man did not know what to say. So he kept his thoughts to himself and continued with the conversation.

There was once a woman. The woman worried about the challeneges she was facing. As she kept conversering, all she could think about is her future.

The man and woman kept moving on with there life as if everything was normal and fine.
